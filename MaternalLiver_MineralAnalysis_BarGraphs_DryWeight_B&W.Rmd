# Overall Study Design
This document details my graphing of mineral analysis data from maternal liver from rats. This analysis uses all data that was sent for ICPOES. ICPOES (Inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry) measured 27 different elements. However, most of these elements were not present in the tissues and were removed prior to analysis, leaving only minerals that were present. All tissue samples were collected between 11/2019-12/2019 by Kaylee Helfrich, Olivia Rivera, Nipun Saini, and Cecilia Kwan. Long-Evans rats arrived at 7 weeks old and were mated at 9-11 weeks of age. The rats were dosed with 5g/kg ethanol or isocaloric maltodextrin from GD13.5-19.5. The dams also received either an iron supplement (6g/kg, Fer-In-Sol) or the same volume of water as a gavage from GD12.5-GD19.5. All dams consumed AIN-76G diet modified to contain 100ppm of iron from arrival through pregnancy. Tissues were harvested on GD20.5. All graphs are mean with standard deviation, since there are not multiple measures per sample. This analysis will allow us to compare the 4 groups. Statistical analysis in JMP will use ANOVA, following checks for normality and variance, to assign significance to the measures. 

## Note: Maternal livers were perfused with 1X phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA. The effectivity of the perfusion may affect the results, as it is apparent that the pattern of most of the minerals is the same, leading me to believe that the only difference is in how well the liver was perfused.
